## Advent of Code - 2025
#### Author: Daniel Hill

This repo contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2025.

Each folder contains a solution along with a README detailing my thought process while working on a solution.

Most solutions will try to avoid external libraries. 

All work is my own, completed without the use of AI or solutions sourced from other users.

#### Code golf

Some solutions are code golfed in Python, meaning they are optimized to minimize text length.
I do this because it's fun to play with some syntactic sugar in Python.

The "rules" of my code golf are as follows:
- Input must be read from a file named "input.txt"
- Output must be in the format "Silver: {}\nGold: {}"
